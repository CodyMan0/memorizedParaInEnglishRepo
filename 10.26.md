1. your knowledge of lexis has two dimenstion : width and depth
2. width describes the general amount of expression you know.
3. depth on the other hand, describes how well you understand their nuances and situational usage (i e in what situations they can be used, their level of formality, common collocatios, cultural connotations, etc).
4. Furthermore, we distinguish between two kinds of lexis knowledge application.
5. One is understanding lexis(passive vocabulary), and the other is knowing how to use it (active vocabulary)
