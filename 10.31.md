Everyone who has ever learned a second language has asked themselves the same qustion
: what is the best way to learn new vocabulary fast? In my work as a language teacher
(and having learned three foreign language myself) one of the most common pieces of advice I've encountered is keeping a vocabulary diary.
The idea is simple: You keep a small noteBook in which you jot down all new expressions you learned and regularly review them.
In its traditional format, you write the expression on the left and **its translation** on the right. Simple enough, right

however, using a vocab diary well is a lesser-known subject.
Perhaps your teacher recommended or forced you to keep a vacab diary, and you may **have obliged by** diligently copying unfamiliar words to look at before exams.
But then what? if you anything like me , you probably never looked at it again.
however vocabulary learing isn't synonymous with short-term vocabulary cramming.
Vocabulary, or lexis as it is called by linguists, should be a tool that's used to communicate and understand more effectively and creatively
Hence, when we learn new lexises, we should do so for the sake of our long-term language development; and that's where vocab diaries can be a valuable resoure.

Easier said than done. First of all, it’s important to acknowledge that there is a time and place for the traditional cramming method.
in preparation for an upcoming language proficiency exam, this is a viable strategy to give your grade an extra boost
But how we learn after the exam is just as important.

Your knowledge of lexis has two dimensions: width and depth.
Width describes the general amount of expressions you know.
Depth, on the other hand, describes how well you understand their nuances and situational usages (i.e. in what situations they can be used, their level of formality, common collocations, cultural connotations, etc).
Furthermore, we distinguish between two kinds of lexis knowledge application.
One is understanding lexis (passive vocabulary), and the other is knowing how to use it (active vocabulary).

Vocabulary diaries aim to develop your language on all four levels:

- By writing down new expressions, you increase the width of your vocabulary.
- As you regularly review them, you develop your understanding and remember the individual lexis items better.

For many people, this is as far as their engagement with vocab diaries goes. Now, here is how you can leverage your diary for the other two levels:

- To increase depth, refer to additional resources like the internet and dictionaries to find example sentences. Add common collocations or synonyms underneath.
- To transfer those expressions from passive to active vocabulary, write down your own example sentences. Review them with teachers or other native speakers.

Your vocab diary should be a **living resource** that grows with you.
If you find new example sentences for expressions, add them.
If you come up with a good example sentence yourself, even better!
Don’t expect your active vocabulary to be as advanced as your passive one.
Committing new lexis to memory is a slow process that requires effort, patience, and practice
**Vocab diaries** are not as shortcut, and they're by no means the only strategy.
**However**, they can be an engaging and inexpensive resource if you use them well.
After all, practicing is not the hard part.
The hard thing is doing it every single day.
